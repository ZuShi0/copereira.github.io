                        <h2>Project Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project was created as part of a requirement for the class. Our group was tasked with
                            creating a Chatbot that could have a reasonably real conversation with the user. We were
                            given
                            freedom to choose any language we wanted, so we opted for JavaScript and HTML to improve the
                            portability of the Chatbot, and to help reduce the overhead of creating a UI. The first 3
                            Iterations
                            were done as a group, and the final iteration was done individually. In the final iteration,
                            I
                            had to
                            implement 2 APIs of my choice.

                        <p>
                            For the 3 group iterations of this project, I was tasked with managing the team,
                            implementing the first iteration of the Porter Stemmer algorithm, improving the ChatBot's
                            vocabulary,creating project demo videos for each iteration, and handling the project
                            documentation.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="desc-i">
                        <h2>Solo Work</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the final iteration, I had to implement 2 APIs. I chose to implement the Google Translate
                            API and the Google Street View Static API.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The Google Translate API felt like an almost necessary
                            choice, since a ChatBot should be capable of speaking different languages. I didn't
                            implement input
                            language detection due to time and capacity constraints, but it could easily be implemented
                            in the future.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            When I was deciding on the 2nd API to implement, I didn't really feel there was an API that
                            could fit with the
                            theme around the ChatBot. After an hour of brainstorming, I realized that there are places
                            on Earth that look
                            similar to places in space. With that, I decided to use the Google Street View Static API to
                            help me source
                            images of these places.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the APIs, I had to make some Quality of Life changes to help integrate the
                            APIs.
                            I implemented a dropdown menu to help make language selection more intuitive, and I added a
                            window for the
                            images to be displayed in.
                        </p>
