                        Overall, my experience working for Electronic Arts Vancouver (EAV) in this cycle
                        was a fun and interesting one. Since I was on the same team at EAV for the two
                        experiences prior to this one, learning the differences in team dynamics and
                        workflow were a huge priortiy for me. The team was small
                        (roughly 5 people, not including management), but was part of a much larger team.
                        Most of my team members were new to the job and the company, so I helped
                        train them and acted as a second-in-command when my team lead was out of office
                        or busy. The workload initially was very light, so we ended up helping the
                        larger team quite frequently.

                        My experience working for Electronic Arts Vancouver (EAV) in this cycle
                        was fun and interesting as always. Being put on the same team as the cycle before made it a lot
                        easier for me to get back into the swing of things. With that, I also had to help
                        train some of the newer team members that joined a week after me. One big experience
                        I had this year that I didn't have last year was that I got to work with Producers
                        more frequently.

                        Working on the Volta Engineering team at Electronic Arts Vancouver (EAV) was something
                        that will be hard to forget. This year, the team was over double the size of my previous
                        team. The responsibilities this team had also varied a lot more than my previous one. One of
                        my larger responsibilities was checking how long the game would take to load into certain
                        modes/areas on 4 different consoles, and then prepare a weekly report on it. I also helped
                        train new members of the team that started after I did.

                        My experience on the Closed Beta QV team at Electronic Arts Vancouver (EAV) is probably
                        my favorite. In addition to testing a completely new game mode, the team members I worked
                        with were great. During my first week my boss asked me if I knew anyone that needed a job,
                        since the team needed more people. I got two of my close friends to join the team soon after
                        and the other three members of the team gelled very well with us. The chemistry our team had
                        was unbeatable. To top it all off, our boss was very caring and an amazing team manager.

                        Working at Electronic Arts Vancouver (EAV) was something that I never expected. The whole
                        experience felt unreal even after a few weeks of working. Getting paid to test video games
                        was one of my childhood dreams, and being able to test FIFA was the icing on the cake.
                        As a fan of soccer (better known as football everywhere outside of North America), FIFA
                        was a large part of my childhood. I played FIFA 06 with my brother, and FIFA 14 was the
                        first FIFA game that I owned. Aside from FIFA, I have played a lot of games made by EA,
                        and working for the very same company felt like an achievement. In addition to learning how
                        the testing process worked, I got to learn more about game development. The amount of work
                        that goes into game development was hard to picture before actually working at a game
                        development
                        company. After my time at EAV, I gained a newfound respect for game development.

                    <p>
                        Joining the Cadets was something that felt out of character for me. The type of activities and
                        the whole theme behind being a cadet was very much outside of my comfort zone. Through my years
                        being a cadet, I did a lot of volunteer work, and I got to experience a lot of different things.
                        One of the most memorable experiences I had was when the whole cadet corps went camping in
                        Vernon, B.C. during the Summer. As a store assistant, I was responsible for handing out
                        uniforms,
                        organizing returned uniforms and taking inventory. Near the end of my time as a cadet, I was
                        taught
                        some helpful leadership skills that I still put into practice today.
