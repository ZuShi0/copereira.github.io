                        This project was created as part of a requirement for the class. Our group was tasked with
                        creating an online shopfront similar to Amazon that utilized SQL to handle the database
                        information.
                        In addition to this, we used JSP and Tomcat to help hook up the website to the database.

                        This project was created as part of a requirement for the class. Our group was tasked with
                        creating a Chatbot that could have a reasonably real conversation with the user. We were given
                        freedom to choose any language we wanted, so we opted for JavaScript and HTML to improve the
                        portability of the Chatbot, and to help reduce the overhead of creating a UI. The first 3
                        Iterations
                        were done as a group, and the final iteration was done individually. In the final iteration, I
                        had to
                        implement 2 APIs of my choice.

                        This project was something that I decided to create in the Summer before my final year
                        at UBCO. The idea of making a web-based portfolio was initially handed to me by my mother.
                        In the past, I would normally apply for jobs with a standard resume in PDF form. After I heard
                        that
                        online portfolios were becoming more popular, I decided to get started on it during my Summer
                        break.
                        I considered using JavaScript and different CSS to help make my site more flashy, but I felt
                        that this would
                        complicate things and detract from the actual purpose of the site. That's one of the main
                        reasons I decided to
                        keep the site simple and clean, but still designed the theme to look unique. With this site, I
                        also ended up
                        learning how to make a website with a responsive layout, and gained more knowledge of HTML and
                        CSS overall.
