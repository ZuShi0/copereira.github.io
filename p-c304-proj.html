                            This project was created as part of a requirement for the class. Our group was tasked with
                            creating an online shopfront similar to Amazon that utilized SQL to handle the database
                            information.
                            In addition to this, we used JSP and Tomcat to help hook up the website to the database.

                        <p>
                            For this project, I ended up contributing most of the work. Out of the ~21 JSP files, I
                            worked on 10 files alone
                            and improved/assisted with the other 11 JSP files. In addition to that, I created the
                            original DDL (SQL Database File) and
                            also wrote almost all the CSS for this project. Near the end of the project, I went through
                            each page and feature
                            to do a final QA test to ensure that the system was functioning as expected. I found ~4
                            major bugs and fixed them before
                            making the project demo video.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I just wanted to mention as well that I am aware of the poor CSS structure throughout the
                            project. Initially, we didn't expect
                            that the project would get so large and complicated, so we went with CSS in each page, as
                            opposed to just using CSS files. This
                            was one of the biggest mistakes I was part of for this entire project, and definitely
                            something that I have improved on since.
                            I think the CSS structure on this website isn't perfect, but it is much better than what I
                            have done in the past.

                            If you visited the GitHub link for this project, you probably noticed that it was posted on
                            July 23rd, 2022.
                            This was because the project wasn't originally developed on GitHub, so I had to import it to
                            GitHub long after
                            the project was completed. We didn't start this project on GitHub since we didn't realize
                            how much work would be
                            involved.
