                        This project is meant to be the culmination of all my accumulated experience gained while 
                        working through my degree at UBCO. As a Capstone Project, it is different in structure 
                        compared to the other projects I've worked on. In this project, our task as a group is 
                        to design a backend attachment that can take text from a user, and output a video. In this 
                        video, users should be able to hear the audio that represents their text, and should be able 
                        to see an avatar "speaking" and gesturing in relation to the audio. One could compare this 
                        project to existing applications like the famous Talking Tom app. Additionally, our project 
                        is meant to teach us how to work as a team, learn how to structure development, and improve 
                        our understanding of the software development process.

                        This project was something that I decided to create in the Summer before my final year
                        at UBCO. The idea of showcasing a web-based portfolio was initially suggested to me by my
                        mother.
                        In the past, I would normally apply for jobs with a standard resume in PDF form. After I heard
                        that
                        online portfolios were becoming more popular, I decided to get started on it during my Summer
                        break.
                        I considered using JavaScript and different CSS to help make my site more flashy, but I felt
                        that this would
                        complicate things and detract from the actual purpose of the site. That's one of the main
                        reasons I decided to
                        keep the site simple and clean, but still designed the theme to look unique. With this site, I
                        also ended up
                        learning how to make a website with a responsive layout, and gained more knowledge of HTML and
                        CSS overall.
