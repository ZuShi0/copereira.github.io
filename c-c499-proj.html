                        <h2>Project Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project is meant to be the culmination of all my accumulated experience gained while 
                            working through my degree at UBCO. As a Capstone Project, it is different in structure 
                            compared to the other projects I've worked on. In this project, our task as a group is 
                            to design a backend attachment that can take text from a user, and output a video. In this 
                            video, users should be able to hear the audio that represents their text, and should be able 
                            to see an avatar "speaking" and gesturing in relation to the audio. One could compare this 
                            project to existing applications like the famous Talking Tom app. Additionally, our project 
                            is meant to teach us how to work as a team, learn how to structure development, and improve 
                            our understanding of the software development process.

                            As the Project Manager, planning out the project was one of my more important tasks. As this 
                            project is something that the group was unfamiliar with, and rather open ended, we needed 
                            a plan that was solid enough to give us direction, while at the same time allowing us to make 
                            changes as needed during development. During our research phase, we found a potential solution 
                            to our problem, but it would be a large development process, that had a potential of failure. 
                            I proposed to have 3 members of the team focus their efforts on that, while I developed a 
                            backup alternative system that we would use in case the main system failed. Over our winter break 
                            I discovered that fully developing the alternate system would result in a product that wouldn't meet our 
                            standards, so I decided to scrap the system, and moved on to hooking up a Front End + Back End to the 
                            headless main system.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Aside from planning, I delegated development tasks in accordance with each members' strengths, 
                            other course load, project responsibilites and weaknesses taken into account. Naturally, I applied 
                            these factors when proposing the plan mentioned above as well. My non-development work load as a 
                            Project Manager was lower than that of my teammates, so it made more sense to me that I alone would work 
                            on the backup system, and ask for help if absolutely needed.

                            During meetings with our professor, I was usually the one responsible for communicating our progress and 
                            concerns as a team. Usually, we held our group meetings every Monday or Friday, which was when we discussed 
                            any issues or concerns about the project. During these meetings, it was my duty to ensure that all concerns 
                            needing attention from our professor be addressed when meeting with the professor.

                        <p>
                            As I briefly mentioned, I was developing the backup system (now deprecated) for this project. You may 
                            wonder why it was necessary, and the answer to that can be found in our choice of language 
                            for this project. The client we were assigned to for this project has a TypeScript backend, 
                            so we wanted to develop a system that would be easy for them to integrate with little effort. 
                            Naturally, we decided that TypeScript would be the best language for this. However, this 
                            made the actual task of the project much harder, since many existing programs that have 
                            the capabilities that we wanted were always written in different languages. Since we didn't 
                            want to compromise the ease of integration, we decided to stick with TypeScript and split 
                            development into two sides. One side would work to rewrite a forced alignment system that 
                            was originally written in Python, completely in TypeScript. The other side, which is what 
                            I have worked on, would work to develop a novel solution completely in TypeScript. This 
                            meant that I would have to design a system that would process user input, process audio, 
                            and generate a video as the end result. This is why I opted to call it, the "Manual System."
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned in the "Group Contribution" section, I decided to deprecate and scrap my Manual System. 
                            After putting in multiple hours of work, I hit a wall when trying to increase the accuracy of the system, 
                            but due to my inexperience and our system limitations, it became very apparent that this system would not be 
                            able to accomplish our goals in full.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My work on our project's FE and BE included writing client side scripts, and server side endpoints that would allow 
                            a user to use a fully interactive site that would take text from the user and a selection of the voice, avatar and aligner 
                            which would eventually send back a video for the user to view. Making this wasn't a requirement from our client, as the meat of 
                            our requirements was the BE video generation engine, but we felt that it would make integration for our client a lot easier. With this 
                            FE, we had a fully integrated and working example of how the client may want to implement our BE system to their site, which made our 
                            technical documentation easier to digest and understand. Functionality was definitely a priority here, so visually it isn't a very pretty 
                            FE. Additionally, testing our system was much easier because of the FE, which lead to us finding a few bugs that I fixed. One nasty bug 
                            (with a simple fix) caused our animation engine to crash due to poor data handling. We also were able to test many kinds of inputs extremely 
                            quickly, and were able to give our client a more complete list of issues and capabilities of our system.
